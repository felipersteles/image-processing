# Image processing

Image processing is a vast field concerned with manipulating, analyzing, and understanding digital images. It involves various techniques to enhance image quality, extract features, and gain insights from visual data. Here's a breakdown of key aspects:

## Applications
- Medical Imaging: Analyzing medical scans (CT, MRI, X-ray) for disease detection, segmentation of organs/tissues, and treatment planning.
- Computer Vision: Object recognition, scene understanding, autonomous vehicles, robotics, and facial recognition systems.
- Remote Sensing: Analyzing satellite and aerial imagery for land cover classification, environmental monitoring, and resource management.
- Security and Surveillance: Object detection, anomaly detection, and activity recognition in video surveillance systems.
- Graphics and Entertainment: Image editing, special effects, video manipulation, and content creation.

## Common Tasks
- Image Enhancement: Techniques to improve image quality for better visualization and analysis. This might include noise reduction, contrast enhancement, sharpening, and color correction.
- Image Restoration: Techniques to recover degraded images corrupted by noise, blur, or artifacts.
- Segmentation: Dividing an image into meaningful regions or objects for further analysis. For example, segmenting a medical image to identify the pancreas or segmenting an image of a road scene to identify vehicles and pedestrians.
- Feature Extraction: Extracting meaningful characteristics from images, such as edges, shapes, textures, and color features. These features can be used for image classification, object recognition, and other tasks.
- Image Classification: Classifying images into predefined categories. For example, classifying images as cats, dogs, or landscapes.
